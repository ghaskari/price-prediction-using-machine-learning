# Price Prediction Project Using Machine Learning Algorithms
This is a Python project that demonstrates how to use different regression models to predict prices. The project includes the following regression models: 
Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost.

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages using pip or conda package manager by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage
- Run python main.py to execute the project.
- The script will read the DemandPrediction.csv file and perform preprocessing on the data.
- The script will then train the four regression models and evaluate their performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Finally, the script will generate the predictions for the XGBoost model and print the results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- numpy 1.19.5
- pandas 1.3.4
- seaborn 0.11.2
- matplotlib 3.4.3
- scikit-learn 1.0.2
- xgboost 1.4.2
